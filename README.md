# Resume
<p>This is an HTML-based resume website with a pinch of CSS (used only for tables). The website is successfully published on GitHub Pages [https://lazypanda673.github.io/WDC-2026-resume/]. The data used in this website is mostly dummy data. I will be updating them with real data soon.</p>

## Setting-Up
<p>Follow the steps below to run this in your local machine--</p>

### Method 1: Cloning the repository
<p>This method requires you to use <b>git</b> and <b>VS code</b>. If you don't have them on your machine, get Git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/">here</a> and VS Code from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here</a>.</p>

#### Step 1: Copying the repo link
<p>Click on the "Code" button, will open a drop-down menu.</p>

</div>
<p>Copy the HTTP link to your clipboard.</p>

#### Step 2: Cloning
<p>Now open your desired folder or directory where you want to save the copy.
Then, right-click on empty-space, click on <b>Open in terminal</b>.
Then type "git clone " and paste the copied link, like this:</p>

```` bash
git clone https://github.com/lazypanda673/WDC-2026-resume.git 
````

<p>You should see a new directory named <b>WDC-2026-resume</b>.</p>

</div>

#### Step 3: Open in VS code
<p>Open the <b>WDC-2026-resume</b> directory, then again open a terminal from this location (as stated above). then, run this command <br>

  ```` bash
  code .
````

and hit "Enter". This will open VS Code from that directory.</p>

</div>
<p>Click on <b>Yes, I trust the authors</b>. Now, you can see the raw HTML code of the website.</p>

#### Step 4: Installing live server
<p>To run it on your local machine, you'd need an extension called <b>live server</b> by Ritwick Dey. Just click on the <b>Extensions</b> icon and search for <b>live server</b>.</p>
<div align="center"><img width="937" height="371" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0479273d-6ebb-4ab5-ae6e-b12c91cc7146" />
</div>
<p>Choose the one you see in the image above and click on <b>Install</b>. It may ask if you trust the publisher, Just click on <b>Trust Publisher & Install</b>.</p>

</div>

#### Step 5: Running the website

<p>You should see a new icon in the bottom-right corner of VS Code. Click <b>Go Live.</b> It should automatically open a new tab in your web browser running on local host. If it does not, check the icon again to get the port number (usually 5500). Now, open a new tab in your browser manually, and search for http://127.0.0.1:5500/ </p>

</div>
<p>This will open a live preview of the website. Any changes you make in the code, upon saving them, it'd reflect in this page.</p>

### Method 2: Downloading the repo
<p>This method is simpler. You just need VS Code.</p>

#### Step 1: Download zip file
<p>Click on the "Code" button, will open a drop-down menu.</p>

</div>
<p>Click on <b>Download ZIP</b>.</p>

#### Step 2: Extract the ZIP file
<p>Go to where you file was downloaded and just right-click on the file. Choose <b>Extract Here</b> or <b>Extract to...</b> as per your choice. This will create a new directory named <b>WDC-2026-resume</b> in the location.</p>

</div>

#### Step 3: Running the website
<p>Just follow the <b>steps 3 to 5</b> from <b>Method 1</b>.</p>

## How to Customize
